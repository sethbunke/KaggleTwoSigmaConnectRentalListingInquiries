The count, mean, min and max rows are self-explanatory. Note that the null values are ignored (so for example count of total_bedrooms is 20,433, not 20,640). The std row shows the standard deviation (which measures how dispersed the values are). The 25%, 50% and 75% rows show the corresponding percentiles: a percentile indicates the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations fall. For example, 25% of the districts have a housing_median_age lower than 18, while 50% are lower than 29 and 75% are lower than 37. These are often called the 25th percentile (or 1st quartile), the median, and the 75th percentile (or 3rd quartile).
